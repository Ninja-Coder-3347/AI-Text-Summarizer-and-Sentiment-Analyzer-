# AI-Text-Summarizer-and-Sentiment-Analyzer-
This project uses NLP and TextBlob to summarize text and analyze sentiment through an interactive python based GUI with WordCloud visualization, improving analytical thinking.
Project Overview

The AI Text Summarizer and Sentiment Analyzer is a Python-based desktop application that applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically summarize large text documents and analyze their sentiment. The project aims to help users quickly understand the key meaning and emotional tone of any text, making it especially useful for students, researchers, and professionals who deal with lengthy content.

Key Features

This application performs two main tasks: text summarization and sentiment analysis. It extracts the most relevant sentences from long paragraphs using NLP and identifies the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral through the TextBlob library. The program features an interactive and easy-to-use GUI built with Tkinter, and it also generates a WordCloud visualization to highlight the most frequent words. Both summarization and sentiment analysis are processed instantly, providing real-time results.

Technologies Used

The project is developed in Python and uses libraries such as TextBlob, NLTK, Tkinter, Matplotlib, and WordCloud. It applies core concepts of Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis, and Text Summarization to extract meaningful insights from text data. The use of Pythonâ€™s GUI framework makes the application interactive and beginner-friendly.

How It Works

The user pastes or types text into the GUI window. The system processes the text using TextBlob and NLTK libraries to extract important sentences and determine the overall sentiment. It then generates a WordCloud for visual representation of frequently used words. The summarized text and sentiment results are displayed instantly within the interface, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience.

Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases practical experience in Python programming, GUI development, and Natural Language Processing. It also helped in improving analytical thinking, creativity, and data interpretation skills by designing an end-to-end intelligent text analysis system.
